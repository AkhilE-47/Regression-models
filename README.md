# Regression-models: KNN Implementation
The dataset contains 28 columns, including categorical and numerical data. Some key columns include:

Age: Numerical
Gender: Categorical
Country: Categorical
family_history, treatment, work_interfere: Categorical
mental_health_consequence: Target Variable (potential)

# Next, perform the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and categorical data.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features.
Encoding: Convert categorical variables to numerical values.
Scaling: Standardize the data for better KNN performance.
Train a KNN Model: Implement and evaluate using accuracy.

# The cleaning and preprocessing. ​​

The data is now cleaned, encoded, and ready for model training. The next steps are:

Select Features and Target: I'll choose mental_health_consequence as the target variable.
Scale the Data: Standardize the features using StandardScaler.
Split the Data: Separate it into training and testing sets.
Train the KNN Model: Fit a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and evaluate it.
